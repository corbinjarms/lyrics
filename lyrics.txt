1. All creatures of our God and King,
Lift up your voice and with us sing
Alleluia, alleluia!
Thou burning sun with golden beam,
Thou silver moon with softer gleam,
O praise him, O praise him,
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.
2. Thou rushing winds that art so strong,
Ye clouds that sail in Heav'n along,
O praise him, alleluia!
Thou rising morn, in praise rejoice,
Ye lights of evening, find a voice.
O praise him, O praise him,
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.
3. And all ye saints of tender heart,
Forgiving others, take your part,
O sing ye, alleluia!
Ye who long pain and sorrow bear,
Praise God and on him cast your care:
O praise him, O praise him,
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.
4. Let all things their creator bless,
And worship him in humbleness,
O praise him, alleluia!
Praise, praise the Father, praise the Son,
And praise the Spirit, Three in One:
O praise him, O praise him,
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.
