# Rejoice


Rejoice in the Lord now and always
Sing it again, we rejoice
Delight in the love He has shown us
Gratefully lift up your voice
His gentleness among us
Will join our hearts with praise
We gather in His goodness
A family of grace

With each breath He has given
Praise the Lord
In these times we live in
We will praise the Lord
Throughout every season
I am sure
We have evеry reason
To praise the Lord



Rеjoice and be anxious for nothing
Prayin' for all that you need
Come with a song of thanksgiving
Lay your requests at His feet
His peace will fall upon us
To guard our hearts and minds
In Christ who reigns eternal
The Shepherd of our lives

With each breath He has given
Praise the Lord
In these times we live in
We will praise the Lord
Through our every season
I am sure
We have every reason
To praise the Lord

Rejoice in the Lord now and always
Tell of the good He has done
Worship the Lord to remember
All of the joy yet to come
The hope that burns within us
The dark cannot destroy
With praise that's neverending
We say again, rejoice

With each breath He has given 
Praise the Lord
In these times we live in
We will praise the Lord 
Through our every season 
I am sure 
We have every reason 
To praise the Lord 

We have every reason 
To praise the Lord


# Sovereign Ruler Of The Skies

Sovereign Ruler of the skies
Ever gracious, ever wise
All my times are in Your hand
All events at Your command
His decree, who formed the earth
Fixed my first and second birth

Now my life to Him I owe
Where He leads me I will go
Ever faithful, ever true
Keep my heart to only You
Since I cannot part from Thee
Sovereign Ruler ever be

Could you stand with us and sing this next verse
Plagues and deaths around me fly
'Til He bids, I cannot die
Not a single shaft can hit
'Til the God of love thinks fit

Times the tempter's power to prove
Times to taste a Savior's love
All must come and last and end
As shall please my heavenly Friend

Ever faithful, ever true
Keep my heart to only You
Since I cannot part from Thee
Sovereign Ruler ever be

He that formed me in the womb
He shall guide me to Thy tomb
And all my times shall ever be
Ordered by His wise decree

Ever faithful, ever true
Keep my heart to only You
Since I cannot part from Thee
Sovereign Ruler ever be

Ever faithful, ever true
Keep my heart to only You
Since I cannot part from Thee
Sovereign Ruler ever be

Thee, at all times, will I bless
Having Thee, I all posses
Since I cannot part from Thee
Sovereign Ruler ever be



# How Firm A Foundation

How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord,
Is laid for your faith in His excellent word!
What more can He say than to you He hath said—
To you who for refuge to Jesus have fled?

“Fear not, I am with thee, oh, be not dismayed,
For I am thy God, and will still give thee aid;
I’ll strengthen thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand,
Upheld by My gracious, omnipotent hand.

“When through the deep waters I call thee to go,
The rivers of sorrow shall not overflow;
For I will be with thee thy trouble to bless,
And sanctify to thee thy deepest distress.

“When through fiery trials thy pathway shall lie,
My grace, all-sufficient, shall be thy supply;
The flame shall not harm thee; I only design
Thy dross to consume and thy gold to refine.

“The soul that on Jesus doth lean for repose,
I will not, I will not, desert to his foes;
That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake,
I’ll never, no never, no never forsake.”
