# Rejoice


Rejoice in the Lord now and always
Sing it again, we rejoice
Delight in the love He has shown us
Gratefully lift up your voice
His gentleness among us
Will join our hearts with praise
We gather in His goodness
A family of grace

With each breath He has given
Praise the Lord
In these times we live in
We will praise the Lord
Throughout every season
I am sure
We have evеry reason
To praise the Lord



Rеjoice and be anxious for nothing
Prayin' for all that you need
Come with a song of thanksgiving
Lay your requests at His feet
His peace will fall upon us
To guard our hearts and minds
In Christ who reigns eternal
The Shepherd of our lives

With each breath He has given
Praise the Lord
In these times we live in
We will praise the Lord
Through our every season
I am sure
We have every reason
To praise the Lord

Rejoice in the Lord now and always
Tell of the good He has done
Worship the Lord to remember
All of the joy yet to come
The hope that burns within us
The dark cannot destroy
With praise that's neverending
We say again, rejoice

With each breath He has given 
Praise the Lord
In these times we live in
We will praise the Lord 
Through our every season 
I am sure 
We have every reason 
To praise the Lord 

We have every reason 
To praise the Lord


# And Can It Be



And can it be that I should gain

An interest in the Savior's blood?

Died He for me, who caused His pain?

For me, who Him to death pursued?

Amazing love! how can it be

That Thou, my God, should die for me?



He left His Father's throne above,

So free, so infinite His grace;

Emptied Himself of all but love,

And bled for Adam's helpless race;

'Tis mercy all, immense and free;

For, O my God, it found out me. 

Amazing love! how can it be

That Thou, my God, should die for me!




Long my imprisoned spirit lay

Fast bound in sin and nature's night;

Thine eye diffused a quick'ning ray,

I woke, the dungeon flamed with light;

My chains fell off, my heart was free;

I rose, went forth and followed Thee. 

Amazing love! how can it be

That Thou, my God, should die for me!


No condemnation now I dread;

Jesus, and all in Him is mine!

Alive in Him, my living Head,

And clothed in righteousness divine,

Bold I approach th'eternal throne,

And claim the crown, through Christ my own. 



# Jesus Shall Reign

Jesus shall reign where'er the sun

does its successive journeys run,

his kingdom stretch from shore to shore,

till moons shall wax and wane no more.



People and realms of every tongue

dwell on his love with sweetest song,

and infant voices shall proclaim

their early blessings on his name.

Blessings abound where'er he reigns:

the prisoners leap to lose their chains,

the weary find eternal rest,

and all who suffer want are blest.



Let every creature rise and bring

the highest honors to our King,

angels descend with songs again,

and earth repeat the loud amen.



# Doxology
Praise God, from whom all blessings flow;
Praise Him, all creatures here below;
Praise Him above, ye heav'nly host;
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
Amen.
